# Networked Tic Tac Toe

A first foray into Javascript and websockets. Only two players can play on the URL at any time; any new players who visit the URL while a game is in play will only be able to watch, because I wasn't interested in implementing rooms.

## TO PLAY:
-----------
  1. Either:
  	* visit https://networkedtictactoe.herokuapp.com
  	* run "npm start" from command line
  2. You can simulate another opponent by using an incognito/private browsing window, or using another browser.
